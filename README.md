## Installation

First, create a conda environment for this project:
```
conda create --name cvapipe python=3.8
conda activate cvapipe
```

then clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/AllenCell/cvapipe_analysis.git
```

and install it with
```
cd cvapipe_analysis
pip install -e .
```

## Types of usage

This package can be ran to reproduce main results from shown in [1] or to generate similar results to your own data. However, before applying to your dataset, we highly recommend you to first run it for reproducibility in our test dataset to understand how the package works.

## The YAML configuration file

TBD

## Running the pipeline to reproduce the paper

This analysis is currently not configured to run as a workflow. Please run steps individually.

### 1. Download the single-cell image dataset manifest including raw GFP and segmented cropped images
```
cvapipe_analysis loaddata run
```

This command downloads the whole dataset of ~7Tb. For each cell in the dataset, we provide a raw 3-channels image containing fiducial markers for cell membrane and nucleus, toghether with a FP marker for one intracellular structure. We also provide segmentations for each cell in the format of 5-channels binary images. The extra two channels corresponds to roof-augmented versions of cell and intracellular structures segmentations. For more information about this, please refer to our paper [1]. Metadata about each cell can be found in the file `manifest.csv`. This is a table where each row corresponds to a cell.

**Importantly**, you can download a *small test dataset composed by 300 cells chosen at random* from the main dataset. To do so, please run
```
cvapipe_analysis loaddata run --test
```

This step saves the single-cell images in the folders `local_staging/loaddata/crop_raw` and `local_staging/loaddata/crop_seg`.

### 2. Compute single-cell features
```
cvapipe_analysis computefeatures run
```

This step extract single-cell features, including cell, nuclear and intracellular volumes and other basic features. Here we also use `aics-shparam` [(link)](https://github.com/AllenCell/aics-shparam) to compute the spherical harmonics coefficients for cell and nuclear shape. This step depends on step 1.

This step saves the features in the file `local_staging/computefeatures/manifest.csv`.

### 3. Pre-processing dataset
```
cvapipe_analysis preprocessing run
```

This step removes outliers and mitotic cells from the single cell dataset. This step saves results in the file `local_staging/preprocessing/manifest.csv` and

**Folder: `local_staging/shapemode/outliers/`**

- `xx.png`: Diagnostic plots for outlier detection.

### 4. Compute shapemodes
```
cvapipe_analysis shapemode run
```

Here we implement a few pre-processing steps. First, all mitotic cells are removed from the dataset. Next we use a feature-based outlier detection to detect and remove outliers form the dataset. The remaining dataset is used as input for principal component analysis. Finally, we compute cell and nuclear shape modes. This step depends on step 2.

A couple of output files are produced on this step:

**Folder: `local_staging/shapemode/pca/`**

- `explained_variance.png`: Explained variance by each principal component.
- `feature_importance.txt`: Importance of first few features of each principal component.

**Folder: `local_staging/shapemode/avgcell/`**

- `xx.vtk`: vtkPolyData files corresponding to 3D cell and nuclear meshes. We recommend [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org) to open this files.
- `xx.gif`: Animated GIF illustrating cell and nuclear shape modes from 3 different projections.
- `combined.tif`: Multichannel TIF that combines all animated GIFs in the same image.

### 5. Create parameterized intensity representation
```
cvapipe_analysis parameterization run
```

Here we use `aics-cytoparam` [(link)](https://github.com/AllenCell/aics-cytoparam) to create parameterization for all the single-cell data. This steps depends on step 2.

**Folder: `local_staging/parameterization/representations/`**

- `xx.tif`: Multichannels TIFF image with the cell representation.

### 6. Create aggregated parameterized intensity representations
```
cvapipe_analysis aggregation run
```

This step generates aggregation of multiple cells representations and morph them into idealized shapes from the shape space. This step depends on steps 3 and 4.

**Folder: `local_staging/aggregation/`**

- `manifest.csv`: Manifest with combinations of parameters used for aggregation and path to TIF file generated.

**Folder: `local_staging/aggregation/repsagg/`**

- `avg-SEG-TUBA1B-DNA_MEM_PC4-B5-CODE.tif`: Example of file generated. This represents the average parameterized intensity representation generated from segmented images of all TUBA1B cells that fall into bin number 5 from shape mode 4.

**Folder: `local_staging/aggregation/aggmorph/`**

- `avg-SEG-TUBA1B-DNA_MEM_PC4-B5.tif`: Same as above but the representation has been morphed into the cell shape corresponding to bin number 5 of shape mode 4.

### 7. Stereotypy analysis
```
cvapipe_analysis stereotypy run
```

This calculates the extent to which a structureâ€™s individual location varied. This step depends on step 4.

**Folder: `local_staging/stereotypy/values`**

- `*.csv*`: Stereotypy values.

**Folder: `local_staging/stereotypy/plots`**

- Resulting plots.

### 8. Concordance analysis
```
cvapipe_analysis concordance run
```

This calculates the extent to which the structure localized relative to all the other cellular structures. This step depends on step 5.

**Folder: `local_staging/concordance/values/`**

- `*.csv*`: Concordance values

**Folder: `local_staging/concordance/plots/`**

- Resulting plots.

## Running the pipeline on your own data

You need to specify the format of your data using a `manifest.csv` file. Each row of this file corresponds to a cell in your dataset and the file is requred to have the following columns:

`CellId`: Unique ID of the cell. Example: `AB98765`.

`structure_name`: FP structure tagged in the cell. Add something like "NA" if you don't have anything tagged for the cell. Example: `TOMM20`.

`crop_raw`: Full path to the multichannel single cell raw image.

`crop_seg`: Full path to the multichannel single cell segmentation.

`name_dict`: Dictionary that specifies the names of each channel in the two images above. Example: `"{'crop_raw': ['dna_dye', 'membrane', 'gfp'], 'crop_seg': ['dna_seg', 'cell_seg', 'gfp_seg', 'gfp_seg2']}"`. In this case, your `crop_raw` images must have 3 channels once this is the number of names you provide in `name_dict`. Similarly `crop_seg` must have 4 channels.

Once you have this manifest file created, you are ready to start using `cvapipe_analysis`. To do so, you should run the step `loaddata` with the additional flag `--csv path_to_manifest`, where `path_to_manifest` is the full path to the manifest file that you created:

`cvapipe_analysis loaddata run --csv path_to_manifest`

All the other steps can be ran without modifications.

## Running the pipeline on a cluster with `sbatch` capabilities

If you are running `cvapipe_analysis` on a Slurm cluster or any other cluster with `sbatch` capabilities, each step can be called with a flag `--distribute`. This will spawn many jobs to run in parallel in the cluster. Specific parameters can be set in the `resources` section of the YAML config file.
